/**
 * Calculates the stress test results for an expense increase from a given event year.

 * and then calculates the residual effects (long-term financial impact) from that event.
 *
 * @param expense - Expense amount to be applied in the event year
 * @param eventYear - Year in which the expense increase occurs, must be within the forecast range
 *
 * @returns An object containing:
 *  - stressEffects: Calculated stress effects, which represent the immediate financial impact of the expense increase
 *    starting at the given eventYear
 *  - residualEffects: Compounded residual effects based on the stress effects, representing the long-term impact of
 *    the expense increase on financials over the forecast period
 *
 * @throws {Error} If the `eventYear` is before the current year or outside of the forecast range
