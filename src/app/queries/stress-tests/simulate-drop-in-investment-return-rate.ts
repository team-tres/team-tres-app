/**
 * Calculates the stress test results based on the investment amount, interest rate, interest rate drop,
 * impacted years, and reinvestment percentage. The function evaluates the difference in balances between
 * baseline and stress test scenarios, and computes the residual effects for each year.
 *
 * This function considers a baseline scenario with an initial interest rate and a stress test scenario
 * where the interest rate is reduced by a specified percentage.
 *
 * @param investmentAmount - Total investment amount
 * @param interestRate - Initial interest rate of the investment, represented in decimal form
 * @param interestRateDrop - Percentage decrease in the interest rate for the stress test, represented in
 *                           decimal form
 * @param impactedYears - Number of years for which the investment is considered
 * @param reinvestmentPercentage - Percentage of interest to be reinvested, represented in decimal form
 *
 * @returns An object containing:
 *  - stressEffects: Calculated stress effects (difference between the baseline and stress test balances)
 *  - residualEffects: Compounded residual effects based on the stress effects, represents the long-term
 *    financial impact
 *
 * @throws {Error} If any of the input values are invalid (e.g., investmentAmount, interestRate, etc.)
