/**
 * Performs a stress test on loan balances by comparing the baseline scenario (with the original
 * interest rate) with a stress test scenario (with a reduced interest rate). This function
 * calculates the loan balances for both scenarios, the principal difference (baseline - stress test),
 * and the residual effects of the loan over time.
 *
 * The function assumes that the baseline interest rate should always be greater than or equal to the
 * stress test interest rate.
 *
 * @param loanAmount Total loan amount, also known as the current debt service
 * @param loanPeriod Loan period in years
 * @param baselineInterestRate Interest rate for the baseline scenario, represented as a decimal
 * @param stressTestInterestRate Interest rate for the stress scenario, represented as a decimal
 *
 * @returns An object containing:
 *  - stressEffects: The calculated principal differences (baseline - stress test), representing the
 *    impact of the interest rate reduction on the loan balances
 *  - residualEffects: The long-term impact of the stress test on the financials over the forecast period
 *
 * @throws {Error} If the baseline interest rate is less than the stress test interest rate
